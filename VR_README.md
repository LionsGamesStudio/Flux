# ü•Ω FluxFramework VR Extension

**Seamlessly extend your reactive FluxFramework projects into immersive Virtual Reality experiences.**

This extension builds on the core principles of FluxFramework, exposing VR hardware state (HMD, controllers) and interactions as reactive properties and events, enabling a fully decoupled VR architecture.

## ‚ú® VR Features

### üéÆ **Centralized VR Management**
- **`FluxVRManager`:** A central hub that automatically discovers and manages the lifecycle of XR devices.
- **Reactive Tracking:** Real-time HMD and controller tracking data (position, rotation, velocity) exposed as global reactive properties.
- **Device Hot-Swapping:** Automatically detects controller connections and disconnections at runtime.

### üïπÔ∏è **Reactive VR Input**
- **`FluxVRController`:** A component that translates raw controller inputs (buttons, triggers, thumbsticks) into reactive properties and a rich set of specific VR events.
- **Integrated Haptic Feedback:** A simple, unified API to trigger haptic feedback on any controller.

### üñºÔ∏è **Spatial UI System**
- **`FluxVRCanvas`:** A world-space canvas optimized for VR, with options for HMD-following ("head-locked") UI.
- **`VRUIInteractor`:** A laser-pointer-based interaction system that seamlessly integrates with Unity's Event System, making standard UI components (Buttons, Sliders) work in VR out-of-the-box.
- **VR-Optimized Components:** `FluxVRButton` and `FluxVRText` provide enhanced visual feedback and functionality for VR environments.

### üö∂ **Flexible Locomotion**
- A complete locomotion system (`FluxVRLocomotion`) with built-in **Teleportation** (with destination validation) and **Smooth Movement**.
- Configurable **Snap/Smooth Turning** options for user comfort.
- Built-in comfort features like screen fading on teleport.

## üöÄ Quick Setup

1.  Ensure you have the core `FluxFramework` package and `com.unity.xr.management` installed.
2.  Import the VR extension package into your project.
3.  Create an empty GameObject in your scene named "**VR Rig**".
4.  Attach the **`FluxVRPlayerPrefab`** component to it. This component will programmatically build a complete, ready-to-use player rig at startup.
5.  Press Play. üéâ

## üéØ Quick Usage Examples

The core principle is to **read** from the reactive properties provided by the VR system and **listen** to VR events.

### 1. Reacting to Controller Input

Your game logic doesn't need to know about XR devices. It just subscribes to a property.

```csharp
// In a WeaponController.cs script
public class WeaponController : FluxMonoBehaviour
{
    private IDisposable _triggerSub;
    private IReactiveProperty<float> _leftTriggerProp;

    protected override void Awake()
    {
        base.Awake();
        
        // Get the property for the left controller's trigger.
        _leftTriggerProp = FluxManager.Instance.GetOrCreateProperty<float>("vr.controller.left.trigger");
        
        // Subscribe to its changes.
        _triggerSub = _leftTriggerProp.Subscribe(OnTriggerChanged);
    }
    
    protected override void OnDestroy()
    {
        _triggerSub?.Dispose(); // Clean up the subscription.
        base.OnDestroy();
    }
    
    private void OnTriggerChanged(float value)
    {
        if (value > 0.8f)
        {
            FireWeapon();
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Listening to VR Interaction Events

Use the `[FluxEventHandler]` attribute to react to high-level VR events.

```csharp
public class InteractionHandler : FluxMonoBehaviour
{
    // This method is automatically subscribed to the VRObjectGrabbedEvent.
    [FluxEventHandler]
    private void OnObjectGrabbed(VRObjectGrabbedEvent evt)
    {
        Debug.Log($"Player grabbed {evt.GrabbedObject.name} with their {evt.ControllerNode}!");
        
        // Find the VR Manager to get the controller and trigger haptics
        var vrManager = FindObjectOfType<FluxVRManager>();
        var controller = vrManager?.GetController(evt.ControllerNode);
        controller?.TriggerHapticFeedback(0.7f, 0.1f);
    }
}
```

### 3. Binding VR UI to Player Data

Binding a VR UI is identical to binding a 2D UI. The components are fully compatible.

```csharp
// On your FluxVRCanvas, you might have a PlayerStatusPanel.cs
public class PlayerStatusPanel : FluxUIComponent
{
    // This declarative attribute is all you need.
    // When "player.health" changes, this VR text will update automatically.
    [FluxBinding("player.health")]
    [SerializeField] private FluxVRText _healthText;
}
```

## üé® Available VR Components

### Core VR
-   `FluxVRManager` - The central hub for the VR rig.
-   `FluxVRController` - Represents a physical controller.
-   `FluxVRLocomotion` - Handles player movement.
-   `FluxVRPlayer` - The "brain" that coordinates systems and handles world interaction.
-   `FluxVRPlayerPrefab` - A factory for building a complete VR rig.

### VR Interaction
-   `VRInteractableObject` - An example of a simple grabbable object.
-   `VRInteractiveButton` - An example of a physically pressable button.
-   `IVRInteractable` - An interface for creating your own interactable objects.

### VR UI
-   `FluxVRCanvas` - The container for a world-space UI.
-   `VRUIInteractor` - The laser pointer component attached to controllers.
-   `FluxVRButton` - A UI button with enhanced visual feedback for VR.
-   `FluxVRText` - A UI text component with VR-specific features like billboarding.

## üîó Integration with Core Framework

The VR extension is a perfect example of building on top of the core framework:

-   ‚úÖ **Reactive Properties:** All hardware states (tracking, input) are exposed as standard reactive properties, making them accessible to any system, including the Visual Scripting editor.
-   ‚úÖ **Event Bus:** All high-level actions (teleporting, grabbing, UI clicks) are published as standard `FluxEvent`s, allowing any system to listen and react without direct dependencies.
-   ‚úÖ **UI Binding:** VR UI components (`FluxVRText`, etc.) are `FluxUIComponent`s, meaning they work seamlessly with the `[FluxBinding]` system.

This creates a powerful, unified development experience, whether you are building for 2D, 3D, or VR.
